These are two versions of netcat for all windows Versions 10,8.1,7,vista,xp.
there is a 64 bit version and a 32 bit version you can download.
But the main Plan behind all this simple stuff is that we can use the Download Links for a Rubber Ducky
Payload (Script) beacuse most of the download Links don't let you download the executables you download an zip archive and than
you have to extrcat netcat and this takes time and isn't even possible to work in a script. 
but you can save some time with download Links to the direct Executables.
